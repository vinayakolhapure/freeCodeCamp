## Smart Contracts

Transactions in a blockchain are a very basic contract - One party sends resources to another.
In the Ethereum blockchain, transactions can support any kind of logic. They have the expressive
power of a Turing-Complete machine - meaning they can be steps for a task that a computer can do.

As a piece of code that sits on the blockchain, a smart contract can automate tasks.
When an account receives money it can automatically distribute it to others.
This is entirely transparent so all the nodes (miners), can see what logic is being executed.

A blockchain with smart contracts, expands the capabilities of the core technology. Ethereum for example, has its own Internet browser, programming language (Solidity) and payment system. It enables users to create decentralized applications (dApps) on its blockchain.

## Blockchain Technologies

Two of the most common technologies used are :
- Ethereum
- Hyperledger
